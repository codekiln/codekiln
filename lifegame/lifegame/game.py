Game logic for Conway's Game of Life and its variants.

This module implements the core game logic for Conway's Game of Life and its variants
(Day & Night, HighLife). It provides functions for:
- Loading and parsing game grids
- Computing cell states and grid evolution
- Rendering grids in different display modes (full block and half block characters)

The grid is implemented as a toroidal (wraparound) 2D space where cells on opposite
edges are considered neighbors.
