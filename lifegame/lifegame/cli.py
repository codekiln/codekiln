"""
Command-line interface for the lifegame package.

This module provides a command-line interface for running Conway's Game of Life
simulations with various configurations. It supports:
- Setting grid dimensions
- Choosing rule variations (Standard Conway, Day & Night, HighLife)
- Selecting display modes (full block or half block characters)
- Configuring simulation parameters (iterations, delay)

The interface is designed to be simple to use while providing access to all
features of the game logic.
