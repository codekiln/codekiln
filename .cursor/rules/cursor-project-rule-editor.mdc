      When editing Cursor project rules:

      1. **Create Draft**:
         - Create a draft in `ai-coding/cursor-project-rule/draft/`:
         ```bash
         mkdir -p ai-coding/cursor-project-rule/draft
         ```
         - Draft should follow the same naming as the target rule
         - Draft should include proper frontmatter and formatting

      2. **Request Approval**:
         - Present the draft to the user for review
         - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
         - If changes are requested, update the draft

      3. **Apply Changes**:
         - Upon approval, copy the draft to `.cursor/rules/` (forcing update if exists):
         ```bash
         cp -f ai-coding/cursor-project-rule/draft/rule-name.mdc .cursor/rules/
         ```
         - Remove the draft:
         ```bash
         rm ai-coding/cursor-project-rule/draft/rule-name.mdc
         ```

      4. **File Organization**:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       └── rule-name.mdc    # Final rule
         └── ai-coding/
             └── cursor-project-rule/
                 └── draft/
                     └── rule-name.mdc # Draft (temporary)
         ```

examples:
  - input: |
      # Draft Rule
